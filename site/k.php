    <h2>Myth: </h2>
    If I agree to donate my organs, the hospital staff            <br />
    won't work as hard to save my life.<br />

</div>
<br /><div class="wpb_wrapper"><h2>Fact
    :
</h2> When you go to the hospital for treatment, doctors<br />
    focus on saving your life â€” not somebody else's.<br />
    You'll be seen by a doctor whose specialty most closely<br />
    matches your particular condition.<br />
</div>
<br /><div class="wpb_wrapper"><h2>Myth
    :
</h2> Maybe I won't really be dead when they sign my death<br />
    certificate.<br />
</div>
<br /><div class="wpb_wrapper"><h2>Fact
    :
</h2> Although it's a popular topic in the tabloids, in<br />
    reality, people don't start to wiggle their toes<br />
    after they're declared dead. In fact, people who have<br />
    agreed to organ donation are given more tests <br/>
    (at no charge to their families) to determine that<br />
    they're truly dead than are those who haven't agreed<br />
    to organ donation.

<br /><div class="wpb_wrapper"><h2>Myth
    :
</h2> I'm under age 18. I'm too young to make this decision.<br />
</div>
<br /><div class="wpb_wrapper"><h2>Fact
    :
</h2> That's true, in a legal sense. But your parents or<br />
    legal guardian can authorize this decision. You<br />
    can express to your family your wish to donate, and they<br />
    can give their consent knowing that it's what you wanted.<br />
    Children, too, are inneed of organ transplants,<br />
    and they usually need organs smaller than those<br />
    an adult can provide.<br />
</div>
<br /><div class="wpb_wrapper"><h2>Myth
    :
</h2> I'm too old to donate. Nobody would want my organs.<br />
</div>
<br /><div class="wpb_wrapper"><h2>Fact
    :
</h2> There's no defined cutoff age for donating organs.<br />
    The decision to use your organs is based on strict<br />
    medical criteria, not age. Don't prematurely disqualify<br />
    yourself. Let the doctors decide at the time of your death<br />
    whether your organs and tissues are suitable for<br />
    transplantation.
</div>
<br /><div class="wpb_wrapper"><h2>Myth
    :
</h2> I'm not in the best of health. Nobody would want my<br />
    organs or tissues.
</div>
<br /><div class="wpb_wrapper"><h2>Fact
    :
</h2> Very few medical conditions automatically disqualify<br />
    you from donating organs. The decision to use an<br />
    organ is based on strict medical criteria. It may turn<br />
    out that certain organs are not suitable for transplantation,<br />
    but other organsand tissues may be fine.<br />
    Don't prematurely disqualify yourself.<br />
    Only medical professionals at the time of your<br />
    death can determine whether your organs are suitable<br />
    for transplantation.<br />

<br /><div class="wpb_wrapper"><h2>Myth
    :
</h2> I'd like to donate one of my kidneys now, but I<br />
    wouldn't be allowed to do that unless one of my<br />
    family members is in need.<br />
</div>
<br /><div class="wpb_wrapper"><h2>Fact
    :
</h2> While that used to be the case, it isn't any longer.<br />
    Whether it's a distant family member, friend or<br />
    complete stranger you want to help, you can donate a<br />
    kidney through certain transplant centers. If you decide<br />
    to become a living donor,you will undergo extensive<br />
    questioning to ensure that you are aware of the risks and<br />
    that your decision to donateisn't based on financial<br />
    gain. You will also undergo testing to determine if your<br />
    kidneys are in good shape andwhether you can live a<br />
    healthy life with just one kidney.<br />

<br /><div class="wpb_wrapper"><h2>Myth
    :
</h2> Rich and famous people go to the top of the list when<br />
    they need a donor organ.<br />
</div>
<br /><div class="wpb_wrapper"><h2>Fact
    :
</h2> The rich and famous aren't given priority when it<br />
    comes to allocating organs. It may seem that way<br />
    because of the amount of publicity generated when a<br />
    celebrity receives a transplant, but they are treated no<br />
    differently from anyone else.The reality is that<br />
    celebrity and financial status are not considered<br />
    in organ allocation.<br />
</div>
<br /><div class="wpb_wrapper"><h2>Myth
    :
</h2> My family will be charged if I donate my organs.<br />
</div>
<br /><div class="wpb_wrapper"><h2>Fact
    : </h2>
    The organ donor's family is never charged for donation.<br />
    The family is charged for the costs of all<br />
    final efforts to save your life, and those costs are<br />
    sometimes misinterpreted as costs related to organ donation.<br />
    Costs for organ removal go to the transplant recipient.<br />
