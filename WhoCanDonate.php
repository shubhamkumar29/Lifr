                    At the time of death the age and medical condition of the person will determine the organs
                    and tissues that can be donated. People of all ages can be considered for organ donation.
                    Very few medical conditions will prevent a person from being able to donate. For example, a
                    person with severe asthma may not be able to donate lungs for transplantation but may be
                    able to donate heart, liver, kidneys and eyes.
                    It is important to understand that the very strict conditions that might prevent you from
                    donating blood may not apply to organ donation and eye donation. There are instances
                    when although you are not able to donate blood, heart valves and skin you can very well
                    donate organs and eyes for transplantation.
                    Even people with cancer can become eligible for donation.

                    <Strong>What organs can be donated by living donors? </Strong> <br /> <br />

                    Living donor transplants are a viable alternative for patients in need of new organs. Many different types

                    of organs can be supplied by living donors, including:

                    <ul>
                    <li><Strong> Kidney </Strong></li>

                    This is the most frequent type of living organ donation. All living kidney donors will experience a

                    decrease in their kidney function, which varies depending on the donor’s age and medical history.

                        <li><Strong> Liver </Strong> </li>

                    Individuals can donate a segment of the liver, which has the ability to regenerate and regain full

                    function.

                        <li> <Strong> Lung </Strong> </li>

                    Although lung lobes do not regenerate, individuals can donate a lobe of one lung.

                        <li> <Strong> Intestine </Strong> </li>

                    Although very rare, it is possible to donate a portion of your intestine.

                        <li> <Strong> Pancreas </Strong> </li>

                    Individuals can also donate a portion of the pancreas.

                        <li><Strong>Heart </Strong> </li>

                    A domino transplant makes some heart-lung recipients living heart donors. When a patient

                    receives a heart-lung &quot;bloc&quot; from a deceased donor, his or her healthy heart may be given to an

                    individual waiting for a heart transplant. Extremely rare, this procedure is used when physicians

                    determine that the deceased donor lungs will function best if they are used in conjunction with the

                    deceased donor heart.
