                A donation is where a person donates their organs and tissues for transplant.
                A transplant can save a person's life or improve their health and quality of life.<br /><br />
               <li> <Strong> Organ donation </Strong></li> <br />
                Donations are made to people with damaged organs that need to be replaced.<br /><br />
                 <li> <Strong>  Tissue donation </Strong></li> <br />
                Tissues can be used to treat many life threatening conditions.
                <br /> </ul>
                There are two types of donation
                -	living
                -	deceased

                If you've never considered organ donation or delayed becoming a donor because of possibly inaccurate information, here are answers to some common organ donation myths and concerns.
               <br />

              <li>  Myth: If I agree to donate my organs, the hospital staff won't work as hard to save my life.
              </li><li> Fact: When you go to the hospital for treatment, doctors focus on saving your life — not somebody else's. You'll be seen by a doctor whose specialty most closely matches your particular condition.
               </li><li>  Myth: Maybe I won't really be dead when they sign my death certificate.
                </li><li> Fact: Although it's a popular topic in the tabloids, in reality, people don't start to wiggle their toes after they're declared dead. In fact, people who have agreed to organ donation are given more tests (at no charge to their families) to determine that they're truly dead than are those who haven't agreed to organ donation.
               </li><li>  Myth: I'm under age 18. I'm too young to make this decision.
               </li><li>  Fact: That's true, in a legal sense. But your parents or legal guardian can authorize this decision. You can express to your family your wish to donate, and they can give their consent knowing that it's what you wanted. Children, too, are in need of organ transplants, and they usually need organs smaller than those an adult can provide.
               </li><li>  Myth: I'm too old to donate. Nobody would want my organs.
               </li><li>  Fact: There's no defined cutoff age for donating organs. The decision to use your organs is based on strict medical criteria, not age. Don't prematurely disqualify yourself. Let the doctors decide at the time of your death whether your organs and tissues are suitable for transplantation.
                </li><li> Myth: I'm not in the best of health. Nobody would want my organs or tissues.
                </li><li> Fact: Very few medical conditions automatically disqualify you from donating organs. The decision to use an organ is based on strict medical criteria. It may turn out that certain organs are not suitable for transplantation, but other organs and tissues may be fine. Don't prematurely disqualify yourself. Only medical professionals at the time of your death can determine whether your organs are suitable for transplantation.
               </li><li>  Myth: I'd like to donate one of my kidneys now, but I wouldn't be allowed to do that unless one of my family members is in need.
                </li><li> Fact: While that used to be the case, it isn't any longer. Whether it's a distant family member, friend or complete stranger you want to help, you can donate a kidney through certain transplant centers.
                </li><li> If you decide to become a living donor, you will undergo extensive questioning to ensure that you are aware of the risks and that your decision to donate isn't based on financial gain. You will also undergo testing to determine if your kidneys are in good shape and whether you can live a healthy life with just one kidney.
                </li><li> Myth: Rich and famous people go to the top of the list when they need a donor organ.
                </li><li> Fact: The rich and famous aren't given priority when it comes to allocating organs. It may seem that way because of the amount of publicity generated when a celebrity receives a transplant, but they are treated no differently from anyone else. The reality is that celebrity and financial status are not considered in organ allocation.
                </li><li> Myth: My family will be charged if I donate my organs.
                 </li><li>Fact: The organ donor's family is never charged for donation. The family is charged for the costs of all final efforts to save your life, and those costs are sometimes misinterpreted as costs related to organ donation. Costs for organ removal go to the transplant recipient.

               <h4><span>Pledge</span></h4>
                It is shocking that 38 people die every day due to the shortage of available organ donors.
                In total, there are more than 60,000 Indians awaiting their organ transplants, while millions of people die each year without signing up as organ and tissue donors. Sadly, an additional person shows up on the organ transplant list every 3 minutes.
                A single organ donor has the potential to save up to 8 lives.
                Register TODAY and join the other  registered organ donors in the country. Together, we can make a positive impact and start saving lives.
